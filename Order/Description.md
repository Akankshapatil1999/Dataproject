## Project Description:
The Order Analysis System is a comprehensive data analysis project that leverages SQL for database management and Python for data processing, analysis, and visualization. The primary goal of this project is to provide detailed insights into customer orders, sales performance, and inventory management, enabling businesses to make informed decisions.

### Key Objectives:
1) Data Extraction and Storage: Use SQL to manage and query a relational database containing order data, including customer information, product details, order history, and transaction records.
2) Ensure data integrity and optimize database performance through proper indexing and normalization.
Data Processing:
3)Utilize Python to extract data from the SQL database.
4) Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
5) Merge and transform datasets to prepare them for analysis.
