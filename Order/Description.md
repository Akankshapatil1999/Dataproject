# Order Analysis Project
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of downloading a retail orders dataset from Kaggle, performing data cleaning and transformation using Python, and finally loading the processed data into a SQL Server database.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to provide a detailed analysis of retail order data. We start by downloading the dataset from Kaggle, cleaning and transforming the data, and then loading it into SQL Server for further analysis and querying.

## Key Objectives:
1) Data Extraction and Storage:\
       1) Use SQL to manage and query a relational database containing order data, including customer information, product details, order history, and transaction 
         records.\
       2) Ensure data integrity and optimize database performance through proper indexing and normalization.
2) Data Processing:
      1) Utilize Python to extract data from the SQL database.
      2) Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
      3) Merge and transform datasets to prepare them for analysis.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:

Python (version 3.6 or later)\
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE\
SQL Server\
Kaggle API credentials\
Libraries Used\
kaggle: To download datasets from Kaggle.\
zipfile: To extract files from zip archives.\
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.\
sqlalchemy: For database interaction.\
Installation
Install the required Python libraries using pip:\

## Conclusion
The Order Analysis System project aims to harness the power of SQL and Python to transform raw order data into valuable business insights. By integrating data management, processing, and analysis capabilities, this project will help businesses optimize their operations, enhance customer experiences, and drive growth.
